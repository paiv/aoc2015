--- Day 25: Let It Snow ---
--- Part Two ---

The machine springs to life, then falls silent again. It beeps. "Insufficient
fuel", the console reads. "Fifty stars are required before proceeding. One star
is available."

..."one star is available"? You check the fuel tank; sure enough, a lone star
sits at the bottom, awaiting its friends. Looks like you need to provide 49
yourself.

You have enough stars to [Start the Weather Machine].

You fill the weather machine with fifty stars. It comes to life!

Snow begins to fall.
